LIX is a readability measure indicating the difficulty of reading a text developed by Swedish scholar Carl-Hugo Bj√∂rnsson. 
It is computed as follows:
LIX= A/B + (C*100)/A, where
A is the number of words,
B is the number of periods (defined by period, colon or capital first letter), and
C is the number of long words (more than 6 letters)
