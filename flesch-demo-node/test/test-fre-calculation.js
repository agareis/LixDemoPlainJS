words beyond a certain length; that it is a measure which ignores the \
linguistic rules of syllabification suggests that it is potentially useful \
across languages. Secondly, Lix calculates the percentage of long words \
from 100 word samples while sentence length is computed from separate 10 sentence samples.',
